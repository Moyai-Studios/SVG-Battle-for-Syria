*SVG: Battle for Syria* follows Sonic and Garfield's allies not only in their fights against each other, but against Emperor Catfish, E, and the other monstrous enemies that await them.

Experience both sides of the war as you journey to defeat your rivals and bring (subjective) peace back to Syria.
