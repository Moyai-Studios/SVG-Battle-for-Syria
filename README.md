# SVG-Battle-for-Syria
The public tracker for Sonic vs Garfield: Battle for Syria, an RPG that's basically an ironic, less serious version of Mario and Luigi (the game, not the characters). A future installation to the series is in mind, but will not be actively worked on until the much later part of the first game's development.
